# task_manager_

An offline TODO App for the browser using React JS.

Key Features :
    -A simple input bar to add tasks on pressing the return-key. + A list of task cards where each task is appended on creation. 
    - Clicking on a task card marks the task as complete and moves it to the bottom of the list. + The active tasks cards appear in order of creation (most recent on     top), while the completed task cards appear in order of completion (most recent on top). 
 -A reset button on the top right corner of the App to clear all tasks and return to initial state. + Hitting the refresh button (including hard refresh) in the browser does not cause any change in the state of the app (it works like a regular offline app). 
 -Created a Hash-tag feature: + Any text in task matching the #hashtag pattern will be separately highlighted. + Clicking on a hashtag should act as a filter and show only task(s) containing that tag. + Hashtags can be stacked and the result should be only task(s) where all of them are present.
